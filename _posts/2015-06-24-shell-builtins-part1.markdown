Take the following hypothetical directory structure:

{% highlight ruby %}
example/
  - a/
  - b/
  - c/
  ...
  - z/
{% endhighlight %}

In this scenario, there several files and subdirectories in each of the sibling directories in `example/`. Now let's say that you want to perform an operation on every one of these directories except `a/`, and because you are lazy, you want to do it in one command (sans pipes, `awk`, `grep`, or other compound, obscure one-liners).

## Some background
Globs already provide a solid set of inclusive pattern matching functionality. A quick review:

|* | wildcard matching (zero or more)|
|? | match exactly one character|
|[ ] | match any character in the brackets|

With these tools at your disposal, one could concievably `mv` every directory except for `a/` by enumerating all of the single letter directory names inside of brackets.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ mv [bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]/ ../
{% endhighlight %}

While this may work in a few limited cases, what if the directory names are more than a single character long?

## Enter extglob
Fortunately, bash has an extended set of glob operators that bring full regular expression pattern matching functionality to a terminal near you! First, investigate what options your shell has preconfigured.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ shopt
...
dotglob         off
execfail        off
expand_aliases  on
extdebug        off
extglob         off
extquote        on
failglob        off
force_fignore   on
...
{% endhighlight %}

Because of the rich set of capabilities extglob provides, it's typically turned off by default to prevent unexpected behavior. Let's turn it on.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ shopt -s extglob
{% endhighlight %}

Voil√†! Courtesy of the bash man page, below is a brief overview of your new toolbox.

?(pattern-list) | Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
*(pattern-list) | Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
+(pattern-list) | Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
@(pattern-list) | Matches one of the given patterns
!(pattern-list) | Matches anything except one of the given patterns

You may notice that the meaning of `?` has now changed, which could cause issues later, but for now, let's tackle the problem at hand: moving everything except for one thing.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ mv !(a) ../
$ ls
a/
{% endhighlight %}

Want to play it safe? Put away the toolbox when you finish using it. Let's disable extglob.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ shopt -u extglob
{% endhighlight %}

For documentation on shell options and globs, `man bash`. For more examples using globs and extglobs, check out [Greg's Wiki](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob).
